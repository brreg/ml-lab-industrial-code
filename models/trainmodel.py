# # Import libraries and packages

#
# # Load Sample data
# iris = datasets.load_iris()
#
# # Split loaded data into independent and target features
# X = iris.data

#
# # Train Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with all data
# svmModel = svm.SVC(kernel='poly', degree=3, C=1.0).fit(X, y)

# # Evalute the model and report

# # Persist model so that it can be used by different consumers
